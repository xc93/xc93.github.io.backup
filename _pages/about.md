My currenct research topics include:
* **matching logic** [[link]](http://matching-logic.org): a unifying logic foundation for programming languages, program properties,
  and program analysis, with a powerful proof system and a small proof checker. 
  I study matching logic's expressive power, soundness and completeness properties,
  decision procedures, and tool support for both interactive and automated reasoning. 
* **K framework** [[link]](https://kframework.org): a unifying semantics-based language framework, with a set of high-performance
  semantics-based language tools.
* **proof generation**: a practical technique to provide formal correctness guarantees to K. Every computation or program
  analysis carried out by K is certified by a machine-checkable matching logic proof object.
